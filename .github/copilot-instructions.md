# ML_Project Copilot Instructions

- This workspace contains a FastAPI backend (Python) and a Next.js frontend (TypeScript).
- The backend should provide `/learn` (POST, CSV upload, trains RandomForest model) and `/ask` (GET, question param, returns prediction) endpoints.
- The frontend should have pages for uploading CSV and querying the backend.
- Use best practices for both Python and JavaScript/TypeScript projects.
